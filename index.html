                    This visualization is good for a couple of reasons.
                    The story this article is trying to tell is really compelling and all the figures are easy to understand.
                    Each figure shows the impact of the Nile with reguards to agriculture, water suppply, and historical context.

                    This chart attempts to show the percentage of people who belive the vaccine is safe by geographic region.
                    The issue is that some countries are not labeled, moreover, this information could be better communicated through something like a bar-graph.
